# Brain Keeper UI

## Project Structures

Since creation of this project, though its functionalities hasn't been growing as fast as I wanted it to be. It has however gone though **several** remodels/resturctures. The main reason for this was my desire of trying to find a good project structure/model/style that I would totally agree with and get exited about. 

Some things that I've come across includes Redux Doc, React Doc, some Medium posts, and Airbnb's style guide. Non of them was perfect in my opinion. So I came up with my own.

### Break the App Apart

- Your app is a website, it will be rendered on a piece of screen. 
- Your app has multiple sections, each section provides some functionalities differ from other sections.
- So your app, in a sense, is a combination of multiple small apps, connected together.

I'm hungre, writing is to be continued...





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
